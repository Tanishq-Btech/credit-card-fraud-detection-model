# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** using a trained ML model and a Flask web interface.

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be integrated with a web application to provide real-time fraud detection, helping financial institutions and businesses reduce losses caused by fraudulent transactions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is one of the major challenges faced by the financial industry. This project uses a supervised machine learning algorithm trained on historical transaction data to classify transactions as fraud or not fraud.

The trained model is saved using Pickle and integrated with a Flask backend. Users can enter transaction details through a web interface and instantly receive a prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a Machine Learning model for fraud detection  
- Create a simple and user-friendly web interface  
- Integrate ML model with Flask backend  
- Predict fraud in real time  
- Demonstrate practical application of ML in cybersecurity and finance
